# React: Design Patterns
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course React: Design Patterns. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

If you’ve learned the basics of React and have worked on many React applications, chances are you’ve run into some recurring problems and situations, like creating reusable layouts or working with forms. If you’ve been on the hunt for solutions to common problems, look no further than this course with Shaun Wassell, where he covers many of the most useful design patterns—effective and repeatable solutions to common application development challenges. This course consists of several sections, each of which will cover a group of React design patterns, ranging from preferred syntax for specific tasks to how to arrange components in the most effective way. Among the topics Shaun covers are composition, higher-order components, state hoisting, controlled vs. uncontrolled components, and many other patterns that help a React app develop into a well-organized codebase.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
